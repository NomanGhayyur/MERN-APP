# MERN CRUD

MERN CRUD is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. It provides a comprehensive solution for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on users.

## Features

- Create: Users can create new user having a "name", "email", & "age".
- Read: Users can retrieve all users from the database.
- Update: Users can update existing "name", "email", & "age" information of any specific _id.
- Delete: Users can delete the entire data of any specific _id from the database.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   $ git clone [repository URL]
   $ cd [project directory]
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   $ cd backend
   $ npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   $ cd ../frontend
   $ npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
   - Specify the following variables in the `.env` file:
     - `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB connection string
     - `PORT`: Port number for the server (e.g., 5000)

5. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   $ cd ../backend
   $ npm run dev
   ```

6. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   $ cd ../frontend
   $ npm start
   ```

7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Usage

[Provide instructions on how to use your application. Include any specific details or steps necessary for users to perform CRUD operations.]

1. Create [data type]:
   - [Explain how users can create a new instance of the data type.]

2. Read [data type]:
   - [Explain how users can view existing instances of the data type.]

3. Update [data type]:
   - [Explain how users can update the information of an existing instance of the data type.]

4. Delete [data type]:
   - [Explain how users can delete an existing instance of the data type.]

## MVC Architecture

[Explain the MVC architecture of your project and how it is implemented.]

The project source code is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

### Frontend

The frontend, located in the `frontend` directory, consists of the view components responsible for the user interface and interactions. It is built using React.js and utilizes the Bootstrap framework for responsive and visually appealing UI components. The frontend communicates with the backend API to perform CRUD operations and display data to the user.

### Backend

The backend, located in the `backend` directory, consists of the server, models, and controllers. It handles incoming requests from the frontend, interacts with the database, and performs the necessary operations. The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The models define the structure and behavior of the [data type] entities, while the controllers handle the business logic and process the requests.

## API Endpoints

[If your project has a RESTful API, provide a

 list of the available endpoints along with a brief description of each endpoint.]

- `GET /api/[endpoint]`: [Description]
- `POST /api/[endpoint]`: [Description]
- `PUT /api/[endpoint]/:id`: [Description]
- `DELETE /api/[endpoint]/:id`: [Description]

## Contributing

[Explain how others can contribute to your project. Include guidelines for submitting bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests.]
